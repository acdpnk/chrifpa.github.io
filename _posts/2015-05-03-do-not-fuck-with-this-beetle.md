>There are more than 500 distinct species of bombardier beetle worldwide—40 in the United States alone—and they can be found on every continent in nearly every sort of climate, save for Antarctica. The prevalence shouldn't be surprising, however, as this expansive class of arthropod has developed one of the most unfuckwithable defense mechanisms in nature: boiling hot sprays of corrosive chemicals. As a result, the beetles have basically no natural predators, crawling the Earth with something like impunity—the human beings of the bug world.
