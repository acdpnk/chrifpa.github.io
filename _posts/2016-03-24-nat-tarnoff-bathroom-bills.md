Content notice (copied from Nat's post): *The following post contains some traumatic and triggering scenarios. There is foul language and references to body parts.*

>North Carolina just made it a law that transgender people will no longer be able to use bathrooms in state owned buildings. Itâ€™s only slightly more nuanced than that, but the reality is that implementing this law means that colleagues, friends, members of my family, and likely me* will not be able to go to the bathroom when visiting anything from schools, to the capitol, to state parks. And this is bullshit.
