Regarding the question of how to explain a gap in employment due to a medical condition (i.e. depression) in an interview:

>Aside from the fact that the details of your condition are not relevant to the job, divulging them puts you and the the hiring manager in a very unfortunate position.

>…

>If you do not divulge unnecessary information, the hiring manager will not have the opportunity to exercise bias.

As a rule I tend to be very open about my history, but I do wonder what the best way to handle it in an interview would be. It never occurred to me hat maybe the hiring manager themself isn't all too keen on knowing more than they need to.
