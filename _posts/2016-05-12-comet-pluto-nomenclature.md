Nomenclature is just words, and all these "classes" of celestial bodies are arbitrary lines in the sand. Pluto, Earth, Jupiter, and [67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko][] are vastly different bodies, and where exactly you draw those lines between them is way less interesting than what makes each of them unique and special. Don't get too caught up in nomenclature.

The real takeaway:

>“These results speak to the power of exploration. Once again we’ve gone to a new kind of place and found ourselves discovering entirely new kinds of expressions in nature.”
