>those following the GamerGate saga have seemed surprised to learn that a crowdsourced mascot and logo created during the donation drive included a color scheme linked to a cartoon rape meme

1. Who is surprised? Certainly not me.
1. If you use offensive symbolism, be prepared to people taking offense. If you didn't mean to be offensive, own up to that and *change it*. Everybody makes mistakes. Then again, this is certainly no mistake.4chan is famous for in-jokes. There's probably people out there who align themselves with #GamerGate and didn't get that. But those who conceived it? They knew. And by now, they all know, and they still think it's a great logo. That is #GamerGate for you.
