>A bit over 3,900 days ago, NASA sent a probe on a meandering course through the inner Solar System. After seven years of gravitational maneuvering, MESSENGER finally arrived at its destination: Mercury, which it became the first spacecraft to visit since 1975's Mariner 10 flyby. Since then, it's been gathering data without much fuss, and without the attention-grabbing surroundings that Cassini benefits from while orbiting Saturn. But its time there has come to an end; out of fuel, the probe is expected to crash into the planet's surface tomorrow.

I'm always a little sad when a spacecraft's mission ends, especially when it ends with a *hard landing*. There are so many of them now that I don't know them all by name, but still so few that it would be possible[^names]. And every single one, especially the deep space missions, is a work of art, a manifestation of decades of hundreds, even thousands of people's hard work, a testament to our willingness to explore. With spacecraft like [Spirit][] or [Pioneer 10 and 11][], at least they're still there. Someone *might* find them someday (more likely in Spirit's than Pioneer's case, but hey – who knows?). Their mission is over, their story not yet[^romantic]. MESSENGER will leave nothing behind but a crater and some debris[^crater] – nothing but an awesome body of science, a legacy that's nothing to sneeze at.

[^names]: I'm talking mostly about science missions, especially interplanetary ones. I don't think anyone could memorize the names of every single satellite.
[^romantic]: I might be over romanticizing this.
[^crater]: Still a relic someone might get tremendous value from someday, but not quite the same as an intact probe.
