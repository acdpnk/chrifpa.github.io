AI, short for Artificial Intelligence, is a very emotionally charged topic these days. In may, super-genius extraordinaire [Stephen Hawking][] wrote an [article][] for the Independent, warning:

>One can imagine such technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand. Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.

[Elon Musk][] even went as far as [comparing][] AI to Atomic Bombs:

>We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.

In his article, Hawking cites the movie [Transcendence][] as a cautonary tale. The plot is quickly summarized: AI researcher and genius Johnny Depp is "uploaded" and thereby "becomes" an AI, soon things get out of control, it's the end of the world as we know it. Humanity perseveres, AI doesn't. If that sounds boring to you -- it is.

Transcendece is a variation on a very old theme. Think of [The Sorcerer's Apprentice][] or [Frankenstein][], [Terminator][] or [Jurassic Park][] -- the list of cautionary tales about human hubris is basically endless. All of these storys share the same narrative: someone creates something more or less intelligent they think they can control, but they can't, and things get out of hand. Some of them end well, others not so much. Moral of the story: You're not as smart as you think you are, and creating life is always a mistake.
*Thou shalt not play God.*
