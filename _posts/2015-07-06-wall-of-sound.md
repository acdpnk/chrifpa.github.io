Fascinating article about the Grateful Dead's (apparently legendary) PA system and the obsessive engineering/art involved in its creation. They ran it for 4 years in the early 70's, at the end of which they were nearly bankrupt due to the Wall's staggering upkeep. While I can't help but wonder to which degree the Wall's legend might have retrospectively enhanced its sound qualities, people familiar with the matter seem to think it's unsurpassed to this day.
