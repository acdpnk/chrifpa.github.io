>The results suggest that humankind is only likely to be unique if the odds of another civilization developing on a habitable world are less than one in 10²². 

Says one of the researchers:

>“To me, this implies that other intelligent, technology producing species very likely have evolved before us,” says Frank. “Think of it this way: before our result you’d be considered a pessimist if you imagined the probability of evolving a civilization on a habitable planet were, say, one in a trillion. But even that guess, one chance in a trillion, implies that what has happened here on Earth with humanity has in fact happened about 10 billion other times over cosmic history!”

That's the thing about the universe: it's unimaginably huge. So chances are:

1. There's other civilizations out there
1. We won't ever talk to them

Which is nothing new, really, but I thought the formula was neat. Also, anything that makes me go read about the [Fermi Paradox][] is a win in my book.
