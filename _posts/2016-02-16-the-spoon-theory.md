Asked about what it's like to live with her chronic illness by a friend, Christine Miserandino came up with the *Spoon Theory*.

>How do I explain every detail of every day being effected, and give the emotions a sick person goes through with clarity. I could have given up, cracked a joke like I usually do, and changed the subject, but I remember thinking if I don’t try to explain this, how could I ever expect her to understand. If I can’t explain this to my best friend, how could I explain my world to anyone else? I had to at least try.

>At that moment, the spoon theory was born.

In some circles it has since become a staple of thinking and talking about conditions — depression, in my case — that limit your capacity of dealing with everyday life. I only came across it recently, and it instantly rang true.
