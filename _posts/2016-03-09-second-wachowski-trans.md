>The second sibling of the filmmaking duo known as The Wachowskis has come out as transgender.

>Lilly Wachowski, 48, sibling of Lana, 50, came out in a statement to Windy City Times, after being threatened with outing by other media.

Lilly:

>Being transgender is not easy. We live in a majority-enforced gender binary world. This means when you're transgender you have to face the hard reality of living the rest of your life in a world that is openly hostile to you. 

Let me be clear: that she came out under threat of being outed against her will by a totally-not-a-tabloid is disgusting. So while I wish she'd had the chance to do it in her own time, her statement is *amazing*. [Go read it](http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/m/APPredirect.php?AID=54509), I could literally have taken the whole thing as a pull quote.
