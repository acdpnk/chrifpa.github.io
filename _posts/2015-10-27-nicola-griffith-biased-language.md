>When I was thirteen (or thereabouts) I sat in a biology class. Yet again we were told, “The sperm penetrates the egg.” Old hat. I was barely listening. But this time I sat up straight and thought, “No, it doesn’t!”

Reminds me of [this xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1015/). Culturally biased language is *everywhere*, especially when it comes to gender, and -- like bad kerning -- once you know how to recognize it you cannot *not* notice it.

As to why this is a problem, from [Emily Martin's](http://web.stanford.edu/~eckert/PDF/Martin1991.pdf) '91(!) paper on the same subject[^martin]:

>At the very least, the imagery keeps alive some of the hoariest old stereotypes about weak damsels in distress and their strong male rescuers. That these stereotypes are now being written in at the level of the *cell* constitutes a powerful move to make them seem so natural as to be beyond alteration.

[^martin]: A commenter on Griffith's article pointed this out. Very interesting, you should totally read it.
