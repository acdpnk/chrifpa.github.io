>The VEST project is an example of sensory substitution—a way to bypass one traditional sensory organ by using another. In the case of VEST, touch is used to replace sound. The device was debuted at TED 2015 where Eagleman explained, “Your brain doesn’t care where it gets information from, it just figures out what to do with it.”
