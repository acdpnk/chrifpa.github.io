>As of November 2013, only 536 people have ever been in space (any flight above 100 kilometres). […] Only 24 of those people left low Earth orbit (on the Apollo missions) and only 12 of those men set foot on the Moon. Seven of the moon walkers are still alive; they're all in their 80s. Six people are currently in space.

Also, mostly men — just saying.
