Solstice is, to me, the most important date of winter. I do not particularly enjoy Christmas, New Years, or my birthday, but Solstice is special. Solstice means the light will come back. It means I made it through the worst. It means I'll survive.

In light of that, I think it's very appropriate that the newest member of my extended family chose this date as their birthday. You chose well, little one. I can not wait to meet you.
